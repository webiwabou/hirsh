# Hirsh — Roadmap to an AI bioinformatics co-scientist

This is a **roadmap of objectives**, not an implementation manual. It describes
where Hirsh is going across evolutionary iterations, from today's guided
pipeline runner to an autonomous **bioinformatics co-scientist**.

## North star

> A scientist describes a biological question in plain language and Hirsh does
> the rest: it figures out the analysis, finds or **composes** the right workflow
> from real nf-core building blocks, negotiates the compute environment and
> infrastructure it needs, runs it reproducibly, explains the results as science
> (not logs), and — when it invents something genuinely new — packages that work
> to nf-core standards and offers to contribute it back.
>
> The scientist should need **no technical knowledge** of Nextflow, containers,
> samplesheets, cluster schedulers or memory tuning. Hirsh carries that load and
> keeps the human in the loop only for the decisions that are theirs to make.

Every iteration should move a real capability closer to that end state while
keeping the invariant that **nothing runs, is deleted, or is published without
explicit human confirmation**.

## How to read this

Milestones are grouped into evolutionary **phases**. Each item is a checkbox
objective, not a task breakdown. Priorities live inside each phase.

- ✅ done · 🔵 next · ⬜ planned

Phases are cumulative: later phases assume earlier ones are solid.

---

## Phase 1 — Guided single-pipeline runner ✅ (shipped)

The MVP: understand intent → select one of a curated set of nf-core pipelines →
parameterize → confirm → run → interpret.

- ✅ Conversational flow (intent → selection → params → confirm → run → interpret)
  - ✅ Confirmations understand natural language, not just a strict `y/n`: common
    phrasings ("sure", "nope", "go ahead", "sí") are accepted, and at the pipeline
    choice the user can answer in free text ("actually it's paired-end WGS") to have
    Hirsh fold that back into the intent and reconsider (`conversation/answers.ts`,
    `confirmOrText`).
- ✅ Swappable LLM backends (Ollama, Anthropic) behind one interface
- ✅ Extensible pipeline registry (rnaseq, sarek, proteinfamilies)
- ✅ Samplesheet construction with FASTQ pair inference
- ✅ Live Nextflow streaming, explicit run confirmation
- ✅ Plain-language results summary + MultiQC pointer
- ✅ Terminal UX (ASCII logo, framed banner, tips), global `hirsh` command

## Phase 1.5 — Trustworthy runs on real machines ✅ (this iteration)

Hardening that makes real runs safe and reviewable, and the first taste of the
infrastructure intelligence that defines the north star.

- ✅ **Resource awareness (memory negotiation).** Before a real run Hirsh compares
  the pipeline's typical needs against the machine (or configured caps) and gives
  an honest verdict: **ok** → run; **adapt** → offer to cap Nextflow to available
  memory/CPUs and warn about the trade-off; **refuse** → recommend *not* running
  here. (The "40 GB pipeline on a 30 GB vs 2 GB machine" story.)
- ✅ **`-params-file` execution.** Parameters are written to a reviewable
  `params.yaml` instead of a long, fragile command line.
- ✅ **Ctrl+C forwarding** so Nextflow shuts its jobs/containers down cleanly.
- ✅ **Test suite** (Vitest) for the pure logic: resource assessment, pair
  inference, command building, config loading.
- ✅ Wire `npm test` into CI (GitHub Actions running build + tests on push/PR).

---

## Phase 2 — Robust, reproducible, and genuinely informative

Make every supported pipeline safe to run for real and make its output land as
*science*.

- ✅ **Validate definitions against upstream.** `npm run verify:defs`
  (`scripts/verify-definitions.mjs`) fetches each pinned pipeline's real
  `nextflow_schema.json` and confirms the revision tag exists and every declared
  param is a real upstream parameter. All three currently pass.
  - ⬜ Remaining: also diff default values, and run it in CI (network permitting).
- ✅ **Richer, quantitative interpretation.** Phase E now reads the numbers that
  matter — per-sample library sizes/column totals from count matrices, per-sample
  metrics from MultiQC's `multiqc_general_stats.txt`, and variant counts from VCFs
  (incl. `.vcf.gz`) — and hands the LLM concrete figures instead of file listings
  (pure parsers in `results/parsers.ts`, unit-tested).
  - ⬜ Remaining: per-tool detail (RSeQC/Picard sections, variant-type breakdowns)
    and small inline tables/charts.
- ✅ **Correct multi-sample designs.** sarek now asks per-sample patient +
  tumor/normal (grouped by patient) and warns when a patient lacks a matched
  normal; rnaseq supports per-sample strandedness (shared default + overrides);
  users can point at an existing samplesheet, which is validated against the
  pipeline's column spec (`validateSamplesheetContent`, unit-tested).
  - ⬜ Remaining: deeper design checks (e.g. balanced conditions, lane merging).
- ✅ **Schema-validated LLM outputs** with one self-correcting retry. Tool-call
  arguments (intent, pipeline selection, composition planning) are validated with
  Zod via `llm/structured.ts`; on a missing/invalid call the model is re-prompted
  once and, if it still fails, the caller falls back gracefully. Makes weaker local
  models (e.g. small Ollama models) far more reliable. Unit-tested with a mock
  provider; verified live end-to-end.
- ✅ **Reproducibility bundle.** Every run writes `run_manifest.json` +
  `PROVENANCE.md` into the run directory, capturing the pipeline + pinned revision,
  the exact command, resolved params (`params.yaml`), samplesheet, environment
  (Nextflow version, container engine, machine/OS), LLM used, and execution status
  — for prepared-but-not-run commands too (`execution/provenance.ts`, unit-tested).
  - ⬜ Remaining: capture resolved container image digests (from the Nextflow run
    report) for byte-exact reproducibility.
- ✅ **Resume & re-run.** After a run, Hirsh offers to run it again — reusing cached
  results with `-resume`, or after changing one parameter (rebuilding `params.yaml`
  and the command, preserving the chosen backend/executor). The `-resume` flag is
  normalized so repeated re-runs never duplicate it; each re-run re-interprets the
  results (`applyResume`/`coerceLike` unit-tested).
- ✅ **The DE gap.** Pipelines can declare a `followUp`; rnaseq now tells the user
  (at selection and in the results) that it produces counts and that
  `nf-core/differentialabundance` is the next step to actually call DEGs. We
  suggest, we do not auto-chain.
  - ⬜ Remaining: offer to run the follow-up directly (still with confirmation).

## Phase 3 — Environment & infrastructure autonomy 🔵 (mostly shipped)

Hirsh should manage *where and how* things run, not just *what* runs — this is
the heart of the "no technical knowledge required" promise. Backend selection,
per-process resource modeling, the executor abstraction, infrastructure
negotiation and container/data staging are in; full toolchain bootstrapping
(installing the backend itself) is the main gap.

- ✅ **Per-process resource modeling.** Pipelines can declare their heavy steps
  (`resources.processes`); the pre-flight then compares each step against the
  memory budget, shows a per-step fit breakdown, and names the specific
  bottleneck. It distinguishes a step whose memory can be capped (slower) from one
  with a hard floor (e.g. STAR/BWA-MEM2 genome indexing) that would simply run out
  of memory — so e.g. rnaseq on a 30 GB machine now *honestly refuses* (indexing
  needs ~38 GB and can't be reduced) instead of vaguely "adapting"
  (`assessProcesses` in `execution/resources.ts`, unit-tested; declared for rnaseq
  and sarek). Falls back to the whole-pipeline model when no steps are declared.
  A step can also declare `skipIfParams`: when the user supplies a prebuilt
  index/reference (or an iGenomes key), that step's memory floor is dropped from
  the assessment — so rnaseq on a 30 GB machine *refuses* when it must build the
  index but is *fine* when `--genome`/a STAR index is provided.
  - ⬜ Remaining: read real per-process peaks from Nextflow trace/execution reports
    instead of curated estimates.
- ✅ **Executor abstraction.** Before a run Hirsh asks *where* to run — local
  machine, an HPC scheduler (Slurm/SGE/LSF/PBS) or AWS Batch — and writes a small
  Nextflow `-c` config that sets `process.executor` (+ queue, and region/S3 work
  dir for AWS Batch), passed on the command line. This works with any pipeline
  without depending on a matching nf-core institutional profile. On a non-local
  executor the local-memory pre-flight is skipped (the scheduler sizes each job),
  and the chosen target is recorded in provenance (`execution/executor.ts`,
  unit-tested).
  - ⬜ Remaining: reuse existing nf-core/configs institutional profiles when the
    scientist names their cluster; Azure/GCP; per-executor account/credential checks.
- ✅ **Infrastructure negotiation.** When the local machine can't run a pipeline
  comfortably, Hirsh no longer just refuses: it presents concrete alternatives —
  cap and run slower here, move to an HPC cluster, or burst to AWS Batch — each
  with a rough **feasibility, time and cost** (e.g. "~$0.49/hour for a ≥38 GB
  node") and a clear recommendation, then carries out the choice (applying caps or
  re-pointing the executor). Estimates are deliberately rough and labeled as such
  (`execution/negotiation.ts`, unit-tested).
  - ⬜ Remaining: detect actual cluster availability/queues, real runtime estimates
    from prior runs, and live cloud pricing instead of a nominal rate.
- ✅ **Container & data staging.** Before a run Hirsh points image/env downloads at
  a stable cache so they're reused across runs (`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` /
  `NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIR`; Docker manages its own store), estimates the run's disk
  footprint (image footprint + input size read from the samplesheet + intermediate
  work ≈ 3× inputs), compares it to the free space on the run filesystem, and warns
  on disk pressure (ok / tight / insufficient) — refusing to silently start a run
  that would hit "no space left" (`execution/staging.ts`, unit-tested). Skipped on a
  non-local executor (data stages on the target).
  - ⬜ Remaining: real image sizes from the pipeline's container manifest, work-dir
    relocation to a bigger disk, and pruning the cache when it grows.
- 🔵 **Toolchain bootstrapping.** On a fresh machine with nothing installed, detect
  what's missing and — with explicit confirmation — install it. Nextflow is now
  self-installable: when it's absent, Hirsh offers to run the official installer
  (checking for Java first) and place the binary on PATH, instead of only printing
  instructions (`execution/environment.ts::bootstrapNextflow`).
  - ⬜ Remaining: install the chosen execution backend itself (Docker/Conda), and a
    compatible Java when missing — today these are still detect-and-guide.
- ✅ **Interactive environment selection.** Before each run Hirsh detects which
  backends are actually available — **Docker, Singularity/Apptainer, Conda or
  Mamba** — recommends the most reproducible one present (keeping the configured
  default if available), and lets the scientist confirm or switch in a short Q&A;
  the choice sets the matching nf-core profile and is recorded in provenance
  (`execution/environment.ts`, unit-tested). Conda/Mamba are now supported backends.
  - ⬜ Remaining: persist the choice back to config, and gate on Docker daemon
    reachability (not just the CLI being present).

## Phase 4 — Composing pipelines from nf-core building blocks ✅ (runnable; refinements remain)

The capability jump: instead of only *choosing* a whole pipeline, Hirsh
*assembles* one by connecting real, versioned **nf-core/modules**. When no
curated pipeline fits, Hirsh composes one from the live catalog, generates a
pinned nf-core-structured project with **channel-type-matched wiring**, and
validates that it **runs end-to-end** — a composed pipeline executes via
`-stub-run` with no hand-editing.

- ✅ **Live module registry.** Tracks [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules)
  in real time: resolves the current commit, lists all ~1,900 modules, and
  parses each module's `meta.yml` (inputs/outputs/tools), cached per commit SHA.
- ✅ **Explainable composition.** The LLM proposes an ordered chain of real
  modules with a rationale per step; the scientist reviews it before generation.
- ✅ **Channel-type-matched synthesis.** A typed channel environment connects each
  module input to the right upstream output by data kind (reads, bam, vcf, fasta,
  indexes, reports…), rebuilds multi-file tuples (e.g. fastp's
  `[meta, reads, adapter]`), carries the `meta` map, routes reference inputs to
  pipeline params, collects reports into MultiQC, and gathers versions via the
  nf-core `versions` channel topic. Verified: real QC and alignment chains
  (fastqc→fastp→bwa/mem→samtools/sort→multiqc) run end-to-end.
  - ⬜ Remaining: smarter semantic disambiguation for unusual channel shapes and
    non-linear (branching/joining) DAGs; today's matcher targets linear flows and
    exposes best-effort choices for review.
- ✅ **nf-core principles by construction.** Generated projects include real
  modules installed from the pinned commit, `modules.json` with git-SHA-pinned
  modules, `nextflow_schema.json` + samplesheet schema, the `meta` map convention,
  version collection via the `versions` topic, `CITATIONS.md`, `.nf-core.yml`, and
  `nextflow.config` with container profiles, resource limits and a **mandatory
  `test` profile** (wired with placeholder data so the stub run works unedited).
  - ⬜ Remaining: bundled realistic `test`/`test_full` data, `nf-test` tests, and
    MultiQC report config by default.
- ✅ **Stub-run + lint validation.** `nextflow config` confirms the project parses,
  a `-profile test -stub-run` executes the whole DAG (no data/containers) as the
  real "does it run" gate, and — when the `nf-core` CLI is available — Hirsh offers
  to run **`nf-core lint` in the loop**, parsing the pass/warn/fail counts and
  surfacing the top failures (advisory: a freshly composed project isn't fully
  green yet). Degrades gracefully when the CLI is missing/unusable
  (`composition/validate.ts::lintPipeline`, parser unit-tested).
  - ⬜ Remaining: a functional test on real data, and iterating fixes until lint is
    green (see Phase 5).
- ✅ **Custom & non-nf-core tools.** A composed pipeline is no longer limited to the
  catalog. During composition Hirsh can take a scientist's own tool/script and
  generate a standards-compliant `modules/local/<name>/main.nf` — the `meta` map, a
  container/conda directive, `versions.yml`, a `when:` guard and a `stub:` block —
  then wire it into the workflow like any nf-core module (mixing `modules/nf-core/`
  with `modules/local/`, as real nf-core pipelines do). Verified end-to-end: a
  pipeline with a generated local module executes via `-profile test -stub-run` with
  no edits (`composition/localModule.ts`, unit-tested).
  - ⬜ Remaining: let the LLM *propose* local tools from intent (today they're
    gathered interactively), multi-input local modules, and per-tool test data.

## Phase 5 — Contributing back to the community 🔵 (packaging + publishing shipped)

When Hirsh builds something new and good, it should help share it — turning a
one-off analysis into reusable, community-grade software.

- ✅ **Standards-compliant packaging.** With explicit opt-in, Hirsh adds the files a
  full nf-core template carries and that lint flags as missing — `LICENSE` (MIT by
  default), `CHANGELOG.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `.gitignore`, a CI workflow, and
  `docs/usage.md` + `docs/output.md` — and fills in the `nextflow.config` manifest
  (author/homePage). It then `git init`s the project with an initial commit (which
  also stops lint failing for "not a git repository") and re-runs lint to show the
  improvement (`composition/packaging.ts` + `execution/git.ts`, unit-tested; the
  patched config verified to still parse).
  - ⬜ Remaining: generated `nf-test` tests and full-size `test`/`test_full` data.
- 🔵 **Local quality gate.** `nf-core lint` runs in the composition loop and after
  packaging (Phase 4); iterating fixes automatically until green is still to do.
- 🔵 **Assisted contribution.** For a custom local tool, Hirsh writes it out in the
  nf-core/modules layout — `main.nf` (no generator comment), `meta.yml`,
  `environment.yml` (conda) and an `nf-test` stub test with the right tags — under
  `contributions/<name>/`, then guides the PR (fork, add real test data, run
  `nf-core modules test`/`lint`, open the PR). Opening the PR stays a deliberate
  human step, and Hirsh is explicit that nf-core acceptance is a community decision
  (`composition/contribution.ts`, unit-tested).
  - ⬜ Remaining: automate the fork+branch+draft-PR via `gh` (with consent), and
    generate the nf-test snapshot from real bundled test data.
- ✅ **Publish a whole pipeline.** With explicit, double confirmation and defaulting
  to **private**, Hirsh creates and pushes a GitHub repository via the `gh` CLI
  (`execution/publish.ts`). It warns plainly that a public repo is visible and may
  be indexed/cached, checks `gh auth`, and never publishes without consent; it does
  not handle credentials itself.
  - ⬜ Remaining: reach a green `nf-core pipelines lint` and bundle full-size test
    data before recommending publication.
- ⬜ **nf-core inclusion guidance.** Walk the scientist through the community process
  to have a published pipeline adopted into nf-core (requirements, naming, the
  request/review steps), being honest that acceptance is a community decision the
  agent cannot guarantee — it prepares and proposes, people decide.
- ⬜ **Provenance for novelty.** Clearly attribute what was reused vs. newly created,
  so contributions are honest and reviewable.

## Phase 6 — The zero-technical-knowledge co-scientist

The full realization: a scientific collaborator, not a command builder.

- ⬜ **Project memory.** Remember a scientist's datasets, references, past analyses
  and preferences across sessions (opt-in, private).
- ⬜ **Scientific dialogue.** Discuss experimental design, suggest appropriate
  analyses and controls, flag confounders and batch effects, and reason about the
  results' biological meaning.
- ⬜ **Publication-ready output.** Generate figures, methods paragraphs (with correct
  citations and exact versions) and reproducible reports.
- ⬜ **End-to-end autonomy with guardrails.** Take a question all the way to an
  interpreted answer, pausing only at the decisions that are the human's to make —
  destructive actions, spending money, or publishing.

---

## Cross-cutting principles (hold across every phase)

- **Human-in-the-loop for consequential actions.** Explicit confirmation before
  running, deleting, spending, or publishing — no exceptions.
- **nf-core compliance is non-negotiable** for anything Hirsh generates.
- **Reproducibility & provenance by default** — pinned versions, container digests,
  saved params, and a record of what was done and why.
- **Honesty over optimism** — when something is unlikely to work (too little RAM,
  a bad pipeline match), say so plainly and recommend the better path.
- **Provider- and frontend-agnostic** — the conversation logic never hard-codes a
  specific LLM or a specific UI.

## North-star capability checklist

- ⬜ Understands biological intent without the tool being named
- ✅ Selects the right existing pipeline
- ✅ Composes a new pipeline from nf-core modules when none fits (runs via stub; complex DAGs still benefit from review)
- 🔵 Negotiates compute (adapt / relocate / provision) with rough cost & time estimates (live pricing and real runtime estimates next)
- 🔵 Sets up its own toolchain & environment (picks Docker/Singularity/Conda/Mamba and installs Nextflow today; installing the backend itself is next)
- 🔵 Runs on laptop, HPC and cloud transparently (executor selection for local/Slurm/SGE/LSF/PBS/AWS Batch today; Azure/GCP and credential handling next)
- ✅ Composes pipelines that mix nf-core modules with the scientist's own tools (generated modules/local/ + nf-core, runs via stub)
- ✅ Interprets results as science, quantitatively (numbers today; deeper per-tool detail next)
- 🔵 Produces reproducible, publication-ready provenance (run manifest + PROVENANCE.md today; figures/methods next)
- 🔵 Contributes novel, standards-compliant modules and pipelines back to nf-core (packages + publishes to GitHub today; nf-core/modules PRs and inclusion next)
- ⬜ Requires zero Nextflow/infra knowledge from the scientist
